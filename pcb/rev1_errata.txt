FIX
[X] 1N4148 - diode does not have direction indication on PCB

[X] 100nF - one missing on BOM

[X] 4.7uF - one missing on BOM

[X] DIN-connector - BOM refers to male connector, should be PCB female

[X] Holes in PCB for DIN-connector are too small to fit physical connector

[X] Holes in PCB for potentiometer are too close to eachother

[X] Sockets need to be added to BOM

[X] Some component texts are hard to read, move

[X] PCB is designed for 100nF of wrong size

[X] Double-check "chassis-distance" for A.USB, A.Power, MIDI, Volume, Tele

[X] Remove 220R pull-up for MIDI, Arduino has sufficient on-board pull-up

[X] Capicitor + symbol on PCB needs better placement for clarity
